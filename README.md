# IM531 Vue project

## Description

We want to build a crypto dashboard by talking to the various apis provided in the web. There are varius 
open source projects for building GraphQL apis on top of existing crypto rest apis. We intent to use one
of those projects to integrate GraphQL.

The dashboard should be customizable. This includes not only showing the desired currencies but also 
providing a conversion to other currencies.

We do not want to push ourselves into a certain direction with this project, as we want to experiment with
Vue so some features might be added in the future that were not defined in this README. This will be 
documented in the future though.
